## Downloading the Project
There are several ways to download our FTC Skystone (2019-20) repo to use with Android Studio.

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE.git</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

* You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the [Releases](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE/releases) page for this repository.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").
